Game designer, scientist, and engineer
I'm primarily interested in using computers to visualize 

Charlie is an undergraduate currently studying computer science and applied physics at Purdue University. I am a current freshman in Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s School of Computer Science.  My interests include understanding how human culture is manifested in and shaped by technology, people-centric technology development, and teaching.  I am a card game fanatic (as you can see from my Github) and hope to one day be the largest publisher of popular card games on the App Store.  In the meantime, I work on this website, card game AIs, and Project Euler challenges.  I enjoy running, playing violin, and doing just about any type of craft.  I invite you to explore my website at will: plunge into my multifaceted projects, read my varied thoughts, share my exciting travel experiences.  And, once you are ready, check out my resume and contact me!
