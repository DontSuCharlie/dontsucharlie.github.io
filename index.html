	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>I'm currently a Freshman attending Purdue University and majoring in Computer Science. I do plan on pursuing knowledge and experience in fields beyond my current major. So far, my key interests include electronics, environmental sciences, physics, and aerospace engineering.</p>
	<p>About me personally, I constantly worry about the world's current state of affairs. There are far too many issues, including ethics, free will, privacy rights, cultural misunderstanding, technology exceeding beyond our control, and a constantly diminishing budget in humanity's vehicle to beyond Earth.</p>
	<p>However, even though I realize these issues exist, I dedicate most of my free time into the development of video games. Yep! Video games. I hope to use video games as a medium of creative expression that will allow me to motivate the the rest of human society and make the world a better place to live in.</p>
	<p>I'm also maintaining this website. There's a blog devoted to projects, with instructions, notes, and ideas for everyone. There's also a blog devoted to courses I took and am currently taking. There's even a list of random things that I highly recommend. That's a lot of stuff! So quit reading my ramblings and go on! Explore!</p>

	<h3>Philosophy</h3>
	<p>I want human knowledge to grow indefinitely; however, I fear that as we continue to grow, so will the potential to destroy ourselves. As you can see, there's a conflict with that...</p>
